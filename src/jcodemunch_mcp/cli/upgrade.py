"""``jcodemunch-mcp upgrade`` — package upgrade + refresh hooks/config.

Single command for the post-release path that previously required two
steps (``pip install -U jcodemunch-mcp`` and ``jcodemunch-mcp init
--hooks``). Picked up from issue #273: users on Copilot/parallel-session
workflows kept missing the second step and ending up with stale hook
templates pointing at older binaries.

Install-mechanism aware (#357): a pipx- or uv-managed venv ships no
``pip`` module, so the old ``python -m pip install -U`` died with
``No module named pip`` and skipped the hook refresh entirely. We do NOT
guess-and-run a foreign package manager; instead we detect the mechanism,
print the exact upgrade command for it, and still refresh hooks/config
in-process (which needs no pip).
