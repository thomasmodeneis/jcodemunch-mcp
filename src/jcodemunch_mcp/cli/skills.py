"""Claude Agent Skill emission for jCodemunch tool-usage guidance.

The Claude Agent Skill format (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML
frontmatter) is Anthropic's structured way to bundle on-demand expertise
that Claude loads per task rather than carrying in baseline context.

This module emits a `jcodemunch` skill whose body is a tool-usage decision
tree: which jcm tool to reach for given the task at hand. Content is
tier-aware via the same `_filter_policy_for_tools` filter the
CLAUDE.md preamble uses — so a `core`-tier user gets a skill body that
only references tools they actually have.

Lives at:
- Global: ``~/.claude/skills/jcodemunch/SKILL.md``
- Project: ``./.claude/skills/jcodemunch/SKILL.md``

Composes cleanly with the existing CLAUDE.md preamble: preamble is
always-on policy; skill is on-demand procedural expertise. Users who
prefer one over the other can disable either via flags on
``jcm install``.
