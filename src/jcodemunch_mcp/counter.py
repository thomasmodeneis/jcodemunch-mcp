"""The Counter: an adaptive tool surface for jcodemunch-mcp.

Problem this solves
-------------------
jcm exposes ~83 MCP tools. The host serializes every resident tool's schema
into the model's context on every turn (a fixed per-turn token tax), and the
model must select one tool out of ~83 (dispatch dilution). Both costs scale
with tool count and work against jcm's own token-efficiency thesis.

The Counter is a small, stable front door that fronts the full catalog without
removing any capability:

  * ``order(action, args)`` -- single dispatch verb. Re-enters the normal
    tool pipeline for the chosen action. Read-only by default at the boundary:
    state-changing actions require an explicit opt-in, and exec/file-write
    verbs are refused unconditionally (a forward-looking charter tripwire --
    jcm ships none today, and the Counter must never become the surface that
    introduces one).
  * ``menu(query, tier)`` -- discovery. Search/browse the action catalog and
    return compact entries, so all ~83 schemas need not stay resident.
  * ``route(task, execute)`` -- intent to action. Map a natural-language task
    to the best catalog action(s); optionally dispatch the top one. Composes
    with ``assemble_task_context`` / ``plan_turn`` (it recommends them for
    context-gathering intents); it does not replace them.

This module is pure logic with no server import (keeps the dependency one-way:
server.py imports counter, never the reverse). server.py owns the Tool
registration, the live catalog, and call_tool re-dispatch; it hands plain data
to the helpers here.
