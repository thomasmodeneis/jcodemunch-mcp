"""MCP readOnlyHint annotations for Claude Code plan mode.

Claude Code's plan mode prompts for approval on every tool it cannot prove is
read-only. jcm is read-only by charter, so every tool now advertises
ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=...): the query tools are True (plan mode runs them
silently) and the handful that mutate index/session/config state are False (they
still prompt). This is a regression guard for that fix.

The write-set is derived from the authoritative counter.STATE_CHANGING_ACTIONS
(plus index_dependency, order, route) so it can't silently drift from source and
let a mutating tool masquerade as read-only.
