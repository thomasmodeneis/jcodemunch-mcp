"""Regression tests for hook-command path handling on Windows.

Root-cause history (resolved in this commit):

  1. ``_hook_invocation()`` returned the native-slash form on Windows
     (e.g. ``C:\\Python314\\Scripts\\jcodemunch-mcp.EXE``). JSON-encoded
     into settings.json, the command survives as ``C:\\Python314\\...``
     and is later spawned through bash. Bash treats every ``\\`` as an
     escape character and silently eats them, so the executed path
     becomes ``C:Python314Scriptsjcodemunch-mcp.EXE`` -> "command not
     found". Fix: normalise to forward slashes on Windows.

  2. ``_merge_hooks()`` used a substring marker (``"jcodemunch-mcp
     hook-p"``) for legacy duplicate detection. Absolute-path forms
     break the substring because ``.EXE `` sits between ``jcodemunch-mcp``
     and ``hook-p``. Re-running ``init`` therefore appended a second copy
     of every hook on each invocation. Fix: extract the jcm subcommand
     from each command with a regex that survives every path-shape
     variation, and compare subcommands instead of raw strings.

Both bugs together produced the "PreToolUse:Read hook error / command
not found" loop that kept recurring even after manual settings.json
patches.
